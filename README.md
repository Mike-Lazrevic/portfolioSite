# portfolioSite
First Fullstack website to act as a portfolio to showcase my growing web development skills and a place to display my future projects.


# Main Page
So the main page is complete and is fully interactive with HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
You are able to use it comfortably with a PC and mobile devide since on mobile, the top menu adjust to the display screen size and shift to a mobile friendly appraoch (javascript)

# first project!
I am so excited to showcase my first project. It is the previous project I developed in my intro to COmputing Science course, but I added a custamizable text file for the user
to change the game and then click run!
This initiates a python server where I first used the framework FLASK, which is so powerful, but I am still learning. It does not fully work, but I will aim to complete it 
by Feb 26!!!

So please come back to visit this project and then I will upload the website live to the internet the same day it all works.

Thanks!
