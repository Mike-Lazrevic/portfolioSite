#Portfolio Site
This is my first full-stack website, designed as a portfolio to showcase my growing web development skills and serve as a hub for future projects.

#Main Page
The main page is fully interactive, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is optimized for both PC and mobile devices. On mobile, the top menu adapts to screen size, switching to a mobile-friendly layout using JavaScript for enhanced usability.

#First Project
I'm thrilled to showcase my first project! It's an updated version of a project I originally developed in my introductory Computing Science course, now with an added customizable text file for users to modify the game and run it. This triggers a Python server where I first implemented the FLASK framework. Although I’m still learning, it has been a powerful tool.

To visit the home page use the Index.html document.

The project isn’t fully functional yet, but I plan to complete it by the end of the year! Stay tuned, and once it's ready, I’ll upload the live version of the website.

Thanks for visiting!
